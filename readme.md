*too lazy to go on goodreads to search for books*

**Usage**

To use findbook, run the findbook command in your terminal, and use the -b flag to specify the book name and the -n flag to specify the number of records to return.

```bash
findbook -b "Clarice Lispector" -n 5
```

This command will search for books with the keyword "Clarice Lispector" and return the details of up to 5 books.
